0x14. MySQL

Tasks
0. Install MySQL
mandatory
First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.

1. Let us in!
mandatory
In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status

2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes
mandatory
In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
mandatory
Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL
mandatory


Having a replica member on for your MySQL database has 2 advantages:

Redundancy: If you lose one of the database servers, you will still have another working one and a copy of your data
Load distribution: You can split the read operations between the 2 servers, reducing the load on the primary member and improving query response speed
Requirements:
MySQL primary must be hosted on web-01 - do not use the bind-address, just comment out this parameter
MySQL replica must be hosted on web-02
Setup replication for the MySQL database named tyrell_corp
Provide your MySQL primary configuration as answer file(my.cnf or mysqld.cnf) with the name 4-mysql_configuration_primary
Provide your MySQL replica configuration as an answer file with the name 4-mysql_configuration_replica
Tips:
Once MySQL replication is setup, add a new record in your table via MySQL on web-01 and check if the record has been replicated in MySQL web-02. If you see it, it means your replication is working!
Make sure that UFW is allowing connections on port 3306 (default MySQL port) otherwise replication will not work.

Example:

web-01
ubuntu@web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p

5. MySQL backup
mandatory


What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:

The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
