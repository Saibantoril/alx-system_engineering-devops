0x16. API advanced

Tasks
0. How many subs?
mandatory
Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.

Hint: No authentication is necessary for most features of the Reddit API. If you’re getting errors related to Too Many Requests, ensure you’re setting a custom User-Agent.

Requirements:

Prototype: def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)
If not a valid subreddit, return 0.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

1. Top Ten
mandatory
Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.

Requirements:

Prototype: def top_ten(subreddit)
If not a valid subreddit, print None.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.

2. Recurse it!
mandatory
Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.

Hint: The Reddit API uses pagination for separating pages of responses.

Requirements:

Prototype: def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])
Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied. AKA you can add a counter, but it must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
If not a valid subreddit, return None.
NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.
Your code will NOT pass if you are using a loop and not recursively calling the function! This /can/ be done with a loop but the point is to use a recursive function. :)
